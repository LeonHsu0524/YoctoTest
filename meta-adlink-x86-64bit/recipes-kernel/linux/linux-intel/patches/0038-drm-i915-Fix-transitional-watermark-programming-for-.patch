Subject: [PATCH 38/38] drm/i915: Fix transitional watermark programming for
 !gvt

The OTC production kernel integrated some buggy GVT code that included a
copy/paste error for the !gvt branch of an #ifdef; instead of
programming the transitional watermark as upstream does, it tried to
program an (invalid) extra level of regular plane watermarks.
